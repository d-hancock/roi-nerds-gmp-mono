# Development Plan
There is a lot going on with this repository.
- Roi Nerds Site
- the gatsby framework project
- the component library
Keeping all of this straight is hard. Prioritizing what needs to be worked on is harder. This page is intended to layout priorites and strategies to getting each of these projects stood up as MVPs.

# Goals
## Roi Site
This site is going to be the central focus for the time being. It will serve as testing ground for the other pieces of the repo.

## Component Library
The goal is to create and maintain an internal component library that can be used to quickly stand up our websites. It will ideally be framework agnostic so that it can be used for either gatsby or next projects. In a perfect world all components of each site will be implemented with these components.

## Gatsby project
The idea is to create a framework that will allow for distributed mainenence and experimentation across our entire portfolio. The idea is to be able to develop functionality once and use it accross all of our clients so that each benefits from the development of the others. This will ideally allow for optimax style improvments for each site.
