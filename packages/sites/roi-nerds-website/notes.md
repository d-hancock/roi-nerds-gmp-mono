# Gameplan
So I'm going to have to just commit to doing this site using theFront. That means the first draft wont be pretty. But it will be up and should serve as a starting point for splitting off themes and for massaging theFront into an actual usable component library.

The first pass on the site will be somewhere between wireframing and an MVP. I'll see what I can do just using theming. 

Depending on results I'll just leave it, if it looks like ass then I'll start the process of pollishing it. 

## Steps
1. Get the homepage generally laid out using blocks and views from theFront.
2. Get the rest of the MVP pages inplace using copy-paste and hardwired data.
3. Publish the fucker.
4. Refactor and clean the site up.
5. Create components and themes from this site.
6. Turn it into a starter that I can use to quickly get other sites up and running.
