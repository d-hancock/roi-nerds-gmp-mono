// Here we convert data from multiple sources into a unified Post type
// Post data validation is also done here, hence cosnole logs/warnings are allowed
// so we can notify the user during the build stage

// this file will take the types defined in ./types.ts and reexport them and
// create functions for converting GraphQL queries into the data objects we will work with.
