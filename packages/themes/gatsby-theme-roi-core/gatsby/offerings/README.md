This dir will be setup along the same lines as the config directory in the src dir. It will define the following: 
- The types used in relation to offerings data.
- The graphql schema used.
- The api for interacting with the module.
- Any functions used for wrangling the data involved. 
- Any functions used to interact with gatsby or node.

These things will then be pulled into the gatsby dir and used there. Additionally there will be data made availible to the config dir.
