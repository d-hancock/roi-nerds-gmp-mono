# Notes
- Going to start in on the core of the functionality we need out of the core theme. 
- Splitting time with the dumb mockup implementation that will be refactored to incorporate the use of the refactored theme.
- After a dumb version is up it will just be incremetally turned into the core of the platform
- Dev work will start in js and will be refactored into typescript as part of the maturation process instead of initial development.
